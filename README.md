# Module4-Final was [09-14-module3-SNAPS-Base]
This project will house scenes for level design, interiors and exteriors, lighting, audio and particle systems,

## Scene List
- MainMenu - provide access to other scenes
- Probuilder - basic use of probuilder to get comfortable with core functions
- Snaps - using Modern Office and Sci-Fi Industrial props and structure for level creation
- Terrain - exterior level modeling, texturing
- Lighting-direct - experiments with direct lighting types
- Lighting-indirect - experiments with indirect lighting and lightmap baking
- Audio - experiments with 2D and 3D audio
- Particle systems - everything that looks cool that isn't geometry or texture
- **Prototype 3 - Bringing it all together in a small exploration/collection game**


## Deliverable - Team of two
- only implement the final project in this repo
- two scenes, intro and advanced
- you decide how to divide up the work
- completing the goal for a scene moves you to the next scene
- completing the second scene takes you to the end of game scene
- both scenes should have interior and exterior elements
